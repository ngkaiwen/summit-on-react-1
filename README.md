## Application Advantages

Summit Analytics' UI is designed with the user in mind, adhering to the [3-click rule](https://blog.prototypr.io/breaking-design-rules-the-3-click-rule-of-ux-a70404909a45) of user experience. Combined with our simplistic and clean UI in accordance to [Gesalt's principle of simplicity](https://www.canva.com/learn/gestalt-theory/), this meant a [lower cognitive load](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/minimize-cognitive-load/) for our educators using the platform.

<img src="https://github.com/TheIanSim/summit-on-react/blob/master/readMePics/UI.png?raw=true" height="150"> 

Summit analytics is user tested, with feedback from professors in National University of Singapore to improve our application (interview log in [Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/123uOvguJXvnF3VK8amGNs6yYFu523jZ_rpMOY7a3M8E/edit?usp=sharing) for reference). Insights from data are displayed in the form of charts and statistics after extensive data exploration and analysis to aid educators in managing their courses, and administrators in managing their cohort. Detailed analysis specific to individual students and assignments can be accessed by the user. Updates on the data can be pushed through our [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/features/) implementation as well in the application. Specific to Administrators, now users can compare across both cohorts and courses.

<img src="https://github.com/TheIanSim/summit-on-react/blob/master/readMePics/Security.png?raw=true" height="48"> 

Security is enforced through [Firebase user authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/).

<img src="https://github.com/TheIanSim/summit-on-react/blob/master/readMePics/Telegram1.jpeg?raw=true" height="100"> 

Application also includes telegram interaction for real-time classroom interaction and centralised communication (Refer to [User Guide for Educators](https://github.com/TheIanSim/summit-on-react#realtime-questions-educator-only) for guide).

We hope that these features will improve the efficiency of educators in managing their courses.

### Overview Screen

After logging in with your  <font color= 00ced1> credentials </font>, you will arrive at this screen below:

![OverviewPage1](https://github.com/TheIanSim/summit-on-react/blob/master/readMePics/OverviewPage1.png?raw=true)

This is the **Overview Screen**. The inital data loaded is the **Students Overall Data**. This screen loads the following data: 

* Total number of students in the course
* The weakest performers <font color= CCCC00> (bottom 5) </font> of the course
* Overall assignment data per student scatter diagram

<img src="https://github.com/TheIanSim/summit-on-react/blob/master/readMePics/OverviewPage1Chart.png?raw=true" height="400"> 

Intepreting the **Overall Assignment Data per Student** chart:
>A student who appears on the top left corner of the chart is weaker, as this meant that he spent a lot of time on finishing the assignments, and he also did not complete much assignments. 

>Vice versa, a student who appears on the bottom right corner of the chart is a stronger student as he completes more assignments, and at a faster completion time.


By scrolling down, you will now arrive at the **Assignment Overview Screen**.

![OverviewPage2](https://github.com/TheIanSim/summit-on-react/blob/master/readMePics/OverviewPage2.png?raw=true)

The **Assignment Overview Screen** loads the overall data specific to the course. The following data are loaded:

* Total number of assignments in the course
* The assignment release time series
* Overall student data per assignment scatter diagram

<img src="https://github.com/TheIanSim/summit-on-react/blob/master/readMePics/OverviewPage2Chart.png?raw=true" height="400"> 

Intepreting the **Overall Student per Assignment** chart:
>An assignment that appears on the top left corner of the chart may be a more diffucult assignment, as it takes longer to complete on average, and that there is a lower completion rate as well, indicating that less students has completed it.

>Vice versa, an assignment that appears on the bottom right corner of the chart may be an easier assignment, as it takes shorter to complete on average, and that there is a higher completion rate as well, indicating that more students has completed it.

Scroling down further, we reach the **Code Combat Overview Data**, with this loading screen.

 * Completion time percentile per assignment
 
<img src="https://github.com/TheIanSim/summit-on-react/blob/master/readMePics/StudentsPage1Chart2.png?raw=true" height="200"> 

 
Intepreting the **Submissions (of Assignment) over Time** chart:
>The orange timeseries represents the course average rate of submission over time, while the green timeseries represents the student's submission of assignment over time. If the green timeseries is higher than the orange timeseries, then it meant that the student has submitted the assignments earlier than majority of the cohort.
>Vice versa, if the green timeseries is lower than the orange timeseries, then it meant that the student has submitted the assignments later than majority of the cohort.

![StudentsPages1Chart1](https://github.com/TheIanSim/summit-on-react/blob/master/readMePics/StudentsPage1Chart1.png?raw=true)
 
Intepreting the **Completion Time Percentile per Assignment** chart:
>If the assignment submission percentile point is above the 50% completion time percentile, this meant that the student has submitted the assignment ahead of majority of the cohort
>Vice versa, if the assigment submission percentile point is below the 50% completion time percentile, then the student has submitted the assignment behind majority of the cohort.
>The percentile metric by the side of the graph indicates the overall performance of the student. A higher percentile metric meant the student submits all the assignments on a faster time than their peers.

![StudentsPage2](https://github.com/TheIanSim/summit-on-react/blob/master/readMePics/StudentsPage2.png?raw=true)

Scrolling down, the **Students Page** loads the following data regarding Code Combat:
